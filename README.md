# Google-Cloud_Platfrom
Welcome to my Google Cloud Projects repository! This folder showcases my work on cloud-based data engineering, analysis, and visualization projects leveraging various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools and other technologies. Each project demonstrates my skills in handling large datasets, running distributed computations, and building scalable cloud-based solutions.

## Technologies and Tools Used
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): BigQuery, VM Instances, and GCS for cloud storage and computation.
Distributed Processing: Apache Spark and Hive for large-scale data processing and querying.
Data Cleaning: OpenRefine for data preparation and transformation.
Programming: Python with Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
